# web-control
This is a simple HTTP control interface to control systems with a view specified primarily by an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) file.
It aims primarily to serve as a companion to the [xPL](https://github.com/fcorthay/xPL) home control system.

The [wiki](https://github.com/fcorthay/web-control/wiki) shows how to install the web control system.
